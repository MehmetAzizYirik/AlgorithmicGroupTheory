# AlgorithmicGroupTheory
Algorithmic group theory functions shared in this repository are especially developed for the implementations in mathematical chemistry. However, the functions can be used also in different fields also. The functions are mainly from the [C.A.G.E.S](https://www.amazon.com/Combinatorial-Algorithms-Enumeration-Mathematics-Applications/dp/084933988X) book
